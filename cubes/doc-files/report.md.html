System Overview
-------------------------------------------------
This project is my own implementation of the [Cubes](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/cubes/index.html) project from Graphics Codex's projects, in G3D. The project is implemented on top of G3D's _starter_ project, which can open and edit 3D scenes. It contains a few additional scenes as required from the project's specification. Some of these scenes were directly created in a text editor describing their properties, and two of them were made by adding methods to the default _App_ class in the starter project.

The default behaviour of the project is to open my _final_ scene, the user can edit the **settings** in the scene's Any file to modify the behaviour of the animations. The user must reopen the application to see the changes made to the file.

The other scenes can be directly opened without closing the application.

Coordinate System
-------------------------------------------------
G3D uses a right handed coordinate system.

Rotation:
1. Yaw is around the Y axis with positive direction as counter-clockwise.
2. Pitch is around the X axis with positive direction as clockwise.
3. Roll is around the Z axis with positive direction as counter-clockwise.


Results
-------------------------------------------------
I would have been nice to have "native" support for Xcode as it is with Visual Studio.
