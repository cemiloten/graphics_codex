2019-01-07: Final Scene
=============================================================

Here is my final scene for this project.
There are many possibilities starting from here.
This time I could figure out how to add values to a Scene.Any when initializing the app.
I did it the same way it was done in samples/entity.

=============================================================

Finished the Staircase Scene. I couldn't figure out how to create the scene file from Any objects in C++.
So I decided to just construct a big string and doing the stair objects creation with a
for loop and appending to the string at each iteration.

![My implementation of the cornell box](2018-12-29__000_My_implementation_of_the_cornell_box.jpg)

Using Windows at work and Mac at home, I want to be able to work on my projects on both of these
platforms. I expect this to be hard but I believe that I will manage it well after a while.

Being pretty new to the mac environment, I had a lot of problems while trying to install G3D.
Changing the environment variables, not being to build g3d without "sudo" and then realizing
that the user environment variables are not kept even though I am an admin user on my machine.
Windows install went pretty ok (except for doxyfile not working yet).

I worked on the first white cube scene and am going to transition to the rest.
Still trying to figure out how all the documentation, journaling and everything works together.

Note to G3D team:
I would have been nice to have "native" support for Xcode as it is with Visual Studio.

Trying the F4 shorcut for the first time.



2018-10-09: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to
this development journal.
